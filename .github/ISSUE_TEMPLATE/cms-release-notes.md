## Background info list
* [link to relevant GH issues or epics]
* [link to any relevant screenshots or artifacts]
* Who is responsible for the change?
* What team(s) were involved? (e.g. CMS team, VSA facilities, Public website team, VAMC upgrade team)
* What was it like for users before the change?
* What is like for users after the change?
* Technically, what happened?
* Who is affected?
* Where will I see the change?
* Will users need additional training to utilize the change?

## User Story
As a CMS user, I need product release notes that help me understand what changed and how it might affect my work. And because I expect these changes are boring at best and annoying at worst, I need extra encouragement to read them. Entertain me, dangit.
