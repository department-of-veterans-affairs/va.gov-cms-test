## User Story 


## What changed?

### Before 
_insert_screnshot_before_



### After 
_insert_screnshot_after_

Example: The CMS team removed “staged” from the editorial workflow options so editors aren’t distracted by an outdated and underutilized menu options.

## Who is affected?
Example: Anyone who needs to edit, approve, or publish content on VA.gov, including VAMC facilities and the Outreach hub.

## Where will I see the change?
Example: Anywhere you make a change to the moderation state of content, such as when editing, approving, or publishing content.

## Here’s why
Example: The “staged” option was implemented early on in the cms, but a lot has changed since then. We removed this option because it’s no longer relevant to the functioning of the cms or user needs.
