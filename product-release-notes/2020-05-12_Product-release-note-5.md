# CMS product release notes
*05-12-2020*

## üìå Improved: Login, see sections
Like traffic (remember traffic?), lots of extra clicking makes it harder to get where you want to go. We made improvements that direct you to the sections of content you have access to right after logging in.

## üè• Improved: Better proofing for health services 
Editors who want to proof their health services content in the CMS can now see all parts of that content inline on the "view" screen. 
The CMS will display the VHA health service name and description in addition to the VAMC system and facility content so you can see all the health services content that will appear in accordions.
